    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression** (References: Agresti (2007), (Viv Bewick,et all, Statistics review 14: Logistic regression))\n",
    "- In Logistic regression , Probability or Odds of the response variable taking a particular value is modeled based on combination of values taken by the predictor . This is used mostly for solving binary classification problems.\n",
    "- A simple example of wether a person is going to be able to pay back the Loan amount , based on his salary , number of dependents , whether he has a job or not, His current rent , His other investements , His daily expenses and other categorical data present .\n",
    "- Strengths are this is easy to use , linear and is very useful when we need probability estimates of some outcome based on predictors \n",
    "- Weakness : Presence of large number of Predictor values , can often lead to overfitting\n",
    "- I know I have categorical variables present and I have an Outcome which depends on these predictors . The Outcome is the variable \"income\" which we need to predict wether is less than/equal or greater than a value which is division into two . This seems to me as a binary response outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree** (References: Tom Mitchell(2007) Machine Learning ,John F. Magee(1964), Decision Trees for Decision Making)\n",
    "- This technique is also used for Classification. This is used for Buisiness decisions where a company may decide wether to build a small division or a large division to manufacture a new product based on a expected market life of the product, Price of the product , which segment the product is for, profit margin for the product etc. \n",
    "- Strengths - Best suited for discreet output values for the target outcome like boolean classification (eg, yes or no)\n",
    "- Weakness - How deeply to grow the decision tree and the more deep you go, there is a fear of overfitting . Noisy data can also lead to overfitting \n",
    "- It seems at this nascent point that we have classify the target outcome as greater or less than a certain value which makes Decision tree a comaprative fit to find a model which can classify the data based on the categorical predictors available\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Methods**  (References: https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tqchen/pdf/BoostedTree.pdf, Cheng Li. \"A Gentle Introduction to Gradient Boosting\" (PDF))\n",
    "- Use of Gradient boosting This technique is a newer approach and has been widely used in competitions to classify \n",
    "- The ones I am curious about here is techniques like light-gbm and xgboost (xtreme gradient boosting). As these are basically boosted decision trees .\n",
    "- There are a lot of practical examples, one of the best is Kaggle Competitions eg, Netflix Prize sought to substantially improve the accuracy of predictions about how much someone is going to enjoy a movie based on their movie preferences and also ranking algorithms like Google and yahoo\n",
    "- Strengths : Very powerful, it can do regression, classification and ranking \n",
    "- Weakness : They add trees sequentially and they can tend to overfitting which can be controlled using the regularization parameters \n",
    "- This is a combination of Gradient descent and boosting and should provide the best of both the methods for classification. Also based on the references ensemble methods should prove to get better results "

    "- In regards to F score , Gradient boosting is the best when 100% of the sample data is used \n",
    "- In regards to time taken, The time taken by gbm and Logistic regression are the same for this case, probably the reason being this is a smaller sample set and the data at hand is not that large , but with the increase in the size of data , Logistic regression should take time the fact being it is linear , whereas , Gradient Boosting might be taking longer as the number of trees increases .\n",
    "- I think with the current processing power present gbm or xgboost is being used in a lot of places practically and in ML competitions so regardless of size of the datasets being used if gbm is performing better with better accuracy/F(Beta) score then it will be used. Regarding the suitability , considering this is more of a classification problem, gbm being an ensemble algorithm that improves the accuracy of a predictive function through incremental minimization of the error terms (Friedman, 2001, 2002). Based on changes in the datasets we would need to tune parameters such as number of trees used and the maximum depth of the tree which would result in a better accuracy of the model. \n",
    "- This paper **(Brown, I. , Mues, C. An experimental comparison of classification algorithms for imbalanced credit scoring data sets, 2012)** shows a comparision of 10 different classifiers, where gbm seems to be doing very well and is ranked among the top classifier. "

These seem to confirm or close to my thoughts of which features are more relevant. The visualization confirms education-num is the highest relevance , where as I predicted education-level which is the same.\n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- The Final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare slightly below or are a bit lower than the reduced data.\n",
    "- Yes why not. But I think with the kind of processing power available these days, that will be much better than my i-5 windows PC , the focus is more on accuracy most of the time as good processing speed is available for cheap. \n",

    "***Note: May be I am degressing from the topic here, Though unfortunately I tried running some advanced algorithms on a large dataset on one of Kaggle competitions which actually has a limited 8GB or so RAM given to a free account to run on their kernel server and if it exceeds that you will not be able to compute (seems google gives much importance to feature selection, PCA, and optimal preprocessing and algorithms with lower run-time and space complexity O(n))***"
